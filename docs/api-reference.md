## Overview

The Stellar-Save smart contract implements a decentralized Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA) on the Stellar blockchain. This API reference documents all public functions, their parameters, return types, and usage examples.

### Key Concepts

- **Group**: A ROSCA savings group with fixed contribution amounts and cycle duration
- **Cycle**: A time period during which all members contribute
- **Payout**: Distribution of pooled funds to a designated member
- **Payout Position**: Member's turn order for receiving payouts (0-indexed)

### Contract Address

Deploy the contract and note the contract ID for invocation:
```bash
stellar contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/stellar_save.wasm --network testnet
```

---

## Data Types

### Group

Represents a savings group configuration and state.

```rust
pub struct Group {
    pub id: u64,                      // Unique group identifier
    pub creator: Address,             // Group creator's address
    pub contribution_amount: i128,    // Required contribution per cycle (stroops)
    pub cycle_duration: u64,          // Cycle length in seconds
    pub max_members: u32,             // Maximum allowed members
    pub min_members: u32,             // Minimum required members to activate
    pub member_count: u32,            // Current number of members
    pub current_cycle: u32,           // Current cycle number (0-indexed)
    pub is_active: bool,              // Whether group is active
    pub status: GroupStatus,          // Current group status
    pub created_at: u64,              // Creation timestamp
    pub started: bool,                // Whether group has started cycles
    pub started_at: u64,              // Timestamp when group started
    pub paused: bool,                 // Whether group is paused by creator (blocks contributions/payouts)
}
```

### GroupStatus

Lifecycle states of a savings group.

```rust
pub enum GroupStatus {
    Pending,      // Created, waiting for members
    Active,       // Running cycles, accepting contributions
    Paused,       // Temporarily suspended
    Completed,    // All cycles finished
    Cancelled,    // Permanently terminated
}
```

### MemberProfile

Member information within a group.

```rust
pub struct MemberProfile {
    pub address: Address,         // Member's address
    pub group_id: u64,            // Associated group ID
    pub payout_position: u32,     // Turn order for payout (0-indexed)
    pub joined_at: u64,           // Join timestamp
}
```

### ContributionRecord

Tracks individual member contributions.

```rust
pub struct ContributionRecord {
    pub member_address: Address,  // Contributing member
    pub group_id: u64,            // Associated group
    pub cycle_number: u32,        // Cycle of contribution
    pub amount: i128,             // Contribution amount (stroops)
    pub timestamp: u64,           // Contribution timestamp
}
```

### PayoutRecord

Tracks payout distributions.

```rust
pub struct PayoutRecord {
    pub recipient: Address,       // Payout recipient
    pub group_id: u64,            // Associated group
    pub cycle_number: u32,        // Cycle of payout
    pub amount: i128,             // Payout amount (stroops)
    pub timestamp: u64,           // Payout timestamp
}
```

### AssignmentMode

Payout position assignment strategies.

```rust
pub enum AssignmentMode {
    Sequential,              // Join order (default)
    Random,                  // Random shuffle using ledger timestamp
    Manual(Vec<u32>),        // Explicit position assignment
}
```

### ContractConfig

Global contract configuration.

```rust
pub struct ContractConfig {
    pub admin: Address,              // Contract administrator
    pub min_contribution: i128,      // Minimum contribution amount
    pub max_contribution: i128,      // Maximum contribution amount
    pub min_members: u32,            // Minimum group size
    pub max_members: u32,            // Maximum group size
    pub min_cycle_duration: u64,     // Minimum cycle length

## Group Management

### create_group

Creates a new savings group.

**Signature:**
```rust
pub fn create_group(
    env: Env,
    creator: Address,
    contribution_amount: i128,
    cycle_duration: u64,
    max_members: u32,
) -> Result<u64, StellarSaveError>
```

**Parameters:**
- `env`: Soroban environment
- `creator`: Address of the group creator (requires authorization)
- `contribution_amount`: Fixed contribution per member per cycle (stroops, 1 XLM = 10^7 stroops)
- `cycle_duration`: Length of each cycle in seconds
- `max_members`: Maximum number of members allowed

**Returns:**
- `Ok(u64)`: Unique group ID
- `Err(StellarSaveError)`: Error if validation fails

**Automatic Rounding:**
- Contribution amounts are automatically rounded to the nearest 0.01 XLM (100,000 stroops) to prevent precision issues with very small amounts
- For example: 100,050 stroops → 100,000 stroops, 150,001 stroops → 200,000 stroops
- If the rounded amount is ≤ 0, the function returns `InvalidAmount` error

**Errors:**
- `InvalidAmount`: Contribution amount rounds to zero or is invalid
- `InvalidState`: Parameters violate global configuration limits

**Example:**
```rust
// Create a group: 10 XLM per cycle, 7-day cycles, max 5 members
let group_id = contract.create_group(
    env,
    creator_address,
    100_000_000,  // 10 XLM in stroops
    604_800,      // 7 days in seconds
    5             // max 5 members
)?;
```

**CLI Example:**
```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  -- create_group \
  --creator CREATOR_ADDRESS \
  --contribution_amount 100000000 \

**Returns:**
- `Ok(bool)`: true if all members contributed, false otherwise
- `Err(StellarSaveError::GroupNotFound)`: Group doesn't exist

**Example:**
```rust
let complete = contract.is_cycle_complete(env, 1, 0)?;
if complete {
    println!("Cycle 0 is complete, ready for payout");
}
```

---

### get_missed_contributions

Identifies members who haven't contributed in a cycle.

**Signature:**
```rust
pub fn get_missed_contributions(
    env: Env,
    group_id: u64,
    cycle_number: u32,
) -> Result<Vec<Address>, StellarSaveError>
```

**Parameters:**
- `env`: Soroban environment
- `group_id`: ID of the group
- `cycle_number`: Cycle number to check

**Returns:**
- `Ok(Vec<Address>)`: Vector of addresses who haven't contributed
- `Err(StellarSaveError::GroupNotFound)`: Group doesn't exist

**Example:**
```rust
let missed = contract.get_missed_contributions(env, 1, 0)?;
if !missed.is_empty() {
    println!("{} members haven't contributed yet", missed.len());
    for member in missed.iter() {
        println!("Reminder needed for: {}", member);
    }
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Tracking delinquent members
- Sending contribution reminders
- Determining cycle completion status

### get_contribution_deadline

Calculates the deadline timestamp for contributions in a cycle.

**Signature:**
```rust
pub fn get_contribution_deadline(
    env: Env,
    group_id: u64,
    cycle_number: u32,
) -> Result<u64, StellarSaveError>
```

**Parameters:**
- `env`: Soroban environment
- `group_id`: ID of the group
- `cycle_number`: Cycle number

**Returns:**
- `Ok(u64)`: Unix timestamp when cycle deadline expires

let current_time = env.ledger().timestamp();

if current_time > deadline {
    println!("Cycle 0 has expired");
} else {
    let remaining = deadline - current_time;
    println!("{} seconds remaining to contribute", remaining);
}
```

**Calculation:**
```
deadline = started_at + (cycle_number * cycle_duration) + cycle_duration
```

**Returns:**
- `Ok(())`: Configuration successfully updated
- `Err(StellarSaveError::InvalidState)`: Configuration validation failed

**Errors:**
- `InvalidState`: Configuration values are invalid

**Example:**
```rust
let config = ContractConfig {
    admin: admin_address,
    min_contribution: 10_000_000,      // 1 XLM minimum
    max_contribution: 1_000_000_000,   // 100 XLM maximum
    min_members: 2,
    max_members: 20,
    min_cycle_duration: 86_400,        // 1 day minimum
    max_cycle_duration: 2_592_000,     // 30 days maximum
};

contract.update_config(env, config)?;
```

**Validation Rules:**
- `min_contribution > 0`
- `max_contribution >= min_contribution`
- `min_members >= 2`
- `max_members >= min_members`
- `min_cycle_duration > 0`
- `max_cycle_duration >= min_cycle_duration`

**Notes:**
- First call sets the admin (caller becomes admin)
- Subsequent calls require admin authorization
- All new groups must comply with these limits

```rust
// Get member's total contributions
let total = contract.get_member_total_contributions(
    env.clone(),
    group_id,
    member_address.clone()

println!("Total contributed: {} stroops", total);

// Get contribution history
let history = contract.get_member_contribution_history(
    env.clone(),
    group_id,
    member_address.clone(),
    0,   // Start from cycle 0
    10   // Get up to 10 records

for record in history.iter() {
    println!("Cycle {}: {} stroops on {}",
        record.cycle_number,
        record.amount,
        record.timestamp
    );
}

// Check if member received payout
let received = contract.has_received_payout(
    env.clone(),
    group_id,
    member_address.clone()
)?;

// Get payout position
let position = contract.get_payout_position(
    env.clone(),
    group_id,
    member_address.clone()
)?;
println!("Member receives payout in cycle {}", position);
```

---

### Admin Configuration Example

```rust
use stellar_save::ContractConfig;

// Initialize contract configuration
let config = ContractConfig {
    admin: admin_address.clone(),
    min_contribution: 10_000_000,      // 1 XLM minimum
    max_contribution: 1_000_000_000,   // 100 XLM maximum
    min_members: 2,                    // At least 2 members
    max_members: 50,                   // Up to 50 members
    min_cycle_duration: 86_400,        // 1 day minimum
    max_cycle_duration: 2_592_000,     // 30 days maximum
};

contract.update_config(env.clone(), config)?;

// All new groups must comply with these limits
let group_id = contract.create_group(
    env.clone(),
    creator.clone(),
    50_000_000,   // 5 XLM - within limits
    604_800,      // 7 days - within limits
    10            // 10 members - within limits
)?;
```

// List all active groups with pagination
let mut all_groups = Vec::new();
let mut cursor = 0;
let page_size = 10;

loop {
    let groups = contract.list_groups(
        env.clone(),
        cursor,
        page_size,
        Some(GroupStatus::Active)
    )?;
    
    if groups.is_empty() {
        break;
    }
    
    for group in groups.iter() {
        all_groups.push(group.clone());
        cursor = group.id;
    }
    
    if groups.len() < page_size as usize {
        break;
    }
}

println!("Found {} active groups", all_groups.len());
```

## CLI Usage Examples

### Create and Join a Group

```bash
# 1. Create a group
GROUP_ID=$(stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  -- create_group \
  --creator $CREATOR_ADDRESS \
  --contribution_amount 100000000 \
  --cycle_duration 604800 \
  --max_members 5)

echo "Created group: $GROUP_ID"

# 2. Join the group
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  -- join_group \
  --group_id $GROUP_ID \
  --member $MEMBER1_ADDRESS

# 3. Get group details
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  -- get_group \
  --group_id $GROUP_ID
```

---

### Query Contribution Status

```bash
# Check if cycle is complete
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  -- is_cycle_complete \
  --group_id 1 \
  --cycle_number 0

# Get missed contributions
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  -- get_missed_contributions \
  --group_id 1 \
  --cycle_number 0

# Get contribution deadline
stellar contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  -- get_contribution_deadline \
  --group_id 1 \
  --cycle_number 0
```

## Best Practices

### For Group Creators

1. **Set Realistic Parameters**: Choose contribution amounts and cycle durations that members can commit to
2. **Communicate Clearly**: Ensure all members understand the ROSCA mechanics before joining
3. **Assign Positions Fairly**: Use Random mode for fairness or Manual mode for specific arrangements
4. **Activate Promptly**: Activate the group once minimum members join to start cycles

### For Members

1. **Contribute On Time**: Contribute before the cycle deadline to avoid delays
2. **Track Your Position**: Know when you'll receive your payout using `get_payout_position`
3. **Monitor Progress**: Check cycle completion status regularly
4. **Verify Amounts**: Always validate contribution amounts match group requirements

### For Developers

1. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Check error codes and provide user-friendly messages
2. **Use Pagination**: Always paginate when querying lists to avoid gas limits
3. **Cache Group Data**: Cache group details to reduce contract calls
4. **Monitor Events**: Subscribe to contract events for real-time updates
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Test all edge cases including cycle boundaries and state transitions

---

## Gas Optimization Tips

1. **Batch Queries**: Use pagination with appropriate limits (10-50 items)
2. **Cache Static Data**: Store group configuration locally after first fetch
3. **Minimize Storage Reads**: Use query functions that return aggregated data
4. **Event Monitoring**: Listen to events instead of polling for state changes

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**: All state-changing functions require proper authorization
2. **Amount Validation**: Contribution amounts are strictly validated
3. **State Checks**: Operations only allowed in valid group states
4. **Overflow Protection**: All arithmetic operations check for overflow
5. **Immutable Records**: Contribution and payout records cannot be modified

---
